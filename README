This Java program simply queries the Bug's internal service structure
to obtain the IPv4 address of eth1 (or whatever you hard-code) and echo
that value to the internal LCD on the original Bug Labs bug base.
This is rather helpful.

I wrote it very quickly, it does not auto-select between WiFi and
wired, and it does not refresh automatically.

Use the Dragonfly SDK v1.6.x or so to load this on your Bug.
